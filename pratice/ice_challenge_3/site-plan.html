    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The site would provide simple recipes that most people can follow and could be made without too much effort.
      There are many recipes that will have descriptions that will tell you how long the food will take and the cost of
      making it. Our site would help certain people that other cooking sites would not help because they make food for
      the general public. This is the main purpose of this site. </p> <!-- change this -->


    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our audience would be college students that are interested in making their own food instead of relying on fast
      food or TV dinner every day. students that want to make food that is budget friendly for those that can’t buy
      expensive meals. People that want to make food that is fast to make with a short amount of time before heading out
      for work or class. Lasty, people that want to make food that doesn’t require that equipment or be made without
      being in the kitchen waiting to be cooked. </p> <!-- change this -->

    <h2>
      Content
    </h2>
    <h3>Home page</h3>
    <p>
      The main page would help the user by showing different types of food that they can make at home. When checking for
      food they will see the description of the food and see how much it will cost or how long it will take to make it.
      There will eb a picture of the food then a button they will press that will lead them to the page they want to go
      to. If the user knows what they want then, they can click the page they want to go to on the nav bar.
    </p>
    <p>Images for the Home page</p>
    <img src="image/hamburger.webp" alt="image for homepage" width="500" height="500">
    <img src="image/shrimp.webp" alt="image for homepage" width="500" height="500">

    </ul>
    <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
    <p>
      The burger page will have ingredients and instruction parts that will help the user understand the cooking process
      faster. The ingredients list would be first on the page so that the user can start preparing for the cooking
      process. They would need pan, burger seasoning, cheese, then all the topping they would want on the burger. Then
      they can start the instruction part of the cooking process. That would cook the burger on the pan and flip it 3
      times for 8 minutes then assemble the burger. </p>

    </ul>
    <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
    <p>
      The shrimp page would help the user cook good shrimp with an air fryer. At the start of the page the ingredients would be first and they would need the following: shrimp, air fryer, seasoning, and oil. After gathering all that, they would need to dethaw the shrimp in warm water. Next, dry the shrimp then add oil and seasoning then mix. After doing that, cook the shrimp in an air fryer with 400 F for 9 minutes. Then you are done with the shrimp.
