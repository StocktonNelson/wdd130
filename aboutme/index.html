            Stockton, BYU-Idaho freshman, was tasked with creating a website for his club. With limited coding knowledge, I have dove into HTML and CSS tutorials. <br>
            After hours of practice, Stockton built a basic website. I have added images, text, and links. To make it more visually appealing, I have experimented <br>
            with different styles and colors. The website was a success. Stockton's newfound skills opened doors to new opportunities.<br>
